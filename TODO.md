## TODO

- Make a gazebo simulation to test robot

- Add navigation via ROS2

- Add a robot arm

- showcase robot arm, robot navigation, and object detection working all together in a demo

## RVIZ2 + ROS2

- finish ros2_easy lib [Done]

- Add point and click demo to showcase librar(as seperate github which pulls from seperate library which doesn't use LGPL)



## Gazebo sim:

- edit 
  https://github.com/rydb/ROS2_easy
to include the ability to models on the fly:
https://answers.gazebosim.org/question/28844/how-do-you-spawn-an-sdf-in-an-already-running-simulation-in-gazebo-garden/

- add point and click movement system to test physics works inside the simulation

- add lidar support

- interface with navigation to autonomously navigate an abitrary enviorment

## Robot arm:

- plan a robot arm

- add robot arm to model

- simulate robot arm in gazebo sim

- plan circuitry for robot arm

- add robot arm to physical robot

## Object detection

- Add object detection script to robot with camera(see robot specs sheet in robotics general pins for camera)

- Figure out how to integrate object detection with navigation2
